# Registration & Licensing

The IPC uses two different terms to identify the recognition status of an athlete or guide. In the following section, guides are considered as athletes.

An athlete is considered as **REGISTERED** when all required information and documents (see [Registration Process](ipc-licensing-programme/registration-process.md)) have been uploaded to SDMS and IPC confirms correctness. The confirmation is automatically done without notification within 1-2 workdays after the NPC had completed the upload of data and files.

Registered athletes appear in the SDMS screen **License Management > License Overview & Application** (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)) with a license status of *New* or *Pending*. The registration of athletes in the central repository tool of the IPC is free of charge.

Once an athlete is registered in SDMS he obtains a unique identification number, henceforth called the SDMS ID. It is a simple integer unique through all sports, valid for the rest of the athleteâ€™s career, and primarily used for identification in results, rankings, any kind of reports and data exchange processes for major events. The usage of this ID solves the challenges of different spellings or name changes due to marriage.

An athlete is **LICENSED** when the athlete has been registered and officially received a license. Distribution of licenses is handled either through license packages or on an individual basis (see [License Application Process](ipc-licensing-programme/license-application-process.md)). Licensed athletes appear in the SDMS screen **License Overview & Application** with a seasonal license number and license status *Licensed*.
