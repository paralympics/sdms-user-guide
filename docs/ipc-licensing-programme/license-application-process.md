# License Application Process

While licenses were bought for individual athletes in both summer and winter sports with the introduction of the IPC Licensing Programme, the structure of license fees has changed for summer sports with effect from summer season 2017. This chapter provides a basic step-for-step instruction from registration to final licensing, especially to underline the difference between individual license applications and license packages. Details on the processes and related technical steps in SDMS are outlined in the respective chapters of this guide.

## Summer Sport Licenses – License Packages

> How To: License an athlete in a summer sport.

1. Register a new athlete or update an existing athlete by uploading all required data and documents as explained in [Registration Process](ipc-licensing-programme/registration-process.md).
2. Wait for 1-2 workdays until the IPC Sport has reviewed the registration so that the athlete appears in the license section with status *New* (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)).

   a. If the status is not valid, comments explain the issue to be resolved. Once resolved, the assistant within the IPC Sport shall be contacted for review request of the updated documents or data.

   b. If the athlete does not appear within 2 workdays, ensure that all documents and data are uploaded as required, and nationality is confirmed.

   c. If the athlete still does not appear although the profile is correctly filled, the IPC Sport shall be contacted.

3. Make sure that your NPC or NF has paid the licensing invoice for the actual season (see [NPC License Packages](license-management/npc-license-packages.md)). When the licensing invoice has been paid, you can license an unlimited number of athletes.
4. Go to the License Overview & Application page, and select the athlete(s) to be licensed in a specific sport for the actual or next season (see [License Search Form](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md#license-search-form). After final confirmation, all athletes are immediately *Licensed*. Consult [License Fees and Validity](#license-fees-and-validity) for rules of license validity.

## Winter Sport Licenses - Individual Application

> How To: License an athlete in a winter sport.

1. Register a new athlete or update an existing athlete by uploading all required data and documents as explained in [Registration Process](ipc-licensing-programme/registration-process.md).
2. Wait for 1-2 workdays until the IPC Sport has reviewed the registration so that the athlete appears in the license section with status New (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)).

   a. If the status is not valid, comments explain the issue to be resolved. Once resolved, the assistant within the IPC Sport shall be contacted for review request of the updated documents or data.

   b. If the athlete does not appear within 2 workdays, ensure that all documents and data are uploaded as required, and nationality is confirmed.

   c. If the athlete still does not appear although the profile is correctly filled, the IPC Sport shall be contacted.

3. Go to the license page, and select the athlete(s) to be licensed in a specific sport and a specific license programme for the actual or next season (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)). During the process, an invoice specifically related to the selected athletes shall be printed and immediately paid. License status changes to *Pending* for all athletes.
4. Wait for 1-3 weekdays until the IPC Finance Department has confirmed the payment of the license package (see [License Cards](license-management/license-cards.md)). The duration of confirmation might take up to five (5) weekdays depending on your home country and way of payment.
   
   a. If the payment status of the invoice and the license status of the related athletes is still pending after five (5) weekdays, the IPC Finance Department has to be contacted and provided with any kind of proof (signed bank transfer documents, receipts…).

5. Once the payment is confirmed, all athletes are *Licensed*. Consult [License Fees and Validity](#license-fees-and-validity) for rules of license validity.

## Payment Options

The standard payment option is the bank transfer order. The IPC bank account details are indicated on the invoice. The payer shall ensure that he bears for any additional bank fees.

> [!DANGER]
> The invoice number or numbers covered by the payment shall be indicated during the remittance order. The payer’s effort in this regard is appreciated for simplification of payment identification and to avoid delays in the licensing process.

Credit card payment is no longer available. In exceptional cases, a specific request for an alternative solution may be sent to the IPC Finance Department if the standard method of money transfer does not work due to country-specific restrictions and limitations.

## License Fees and Validity

The license fee and validity policy might vary from season to season by sport. Details about the currently applied fee structure can be found in the letter about the IPC Licensing Programme of the respective season.

The license fee (on a per-sport basis) will be invoiced annually and will allow access to an **UNLIMITED** number of licences for your NPC in the relevant sport for the season. The fee that is charged per NPC, per sport and is calculated as the average number of licences (rounded) activated in the sport per season, multiplied by €15 euro per license, plus a €20 euro fixed fee to cover any administration cost (bank charges etc.) that IPC may incur.

NPCs do not need to apply for any license package or invoice. An invoice for licences per Sport will be created automatically by SDMS at the start of each season and should be downloaded by the NPC via SDMS. However, address and tax information must be completed by the NPC before the invoice is valid.

Please transfer the amount in question to the account indicated on the invoice. If the package is bought and athletes are licensed before 31 December 2016 their licences are valid from 01 January 2017 onwards. After 01 January 2017, the licences will be active from the date of activation.

The validity of a license generally begins on the day when the NPC officially licensed the athlete with help of purchased and paid license package until the 31 December of the respective season. Since the licensing programme usually opens in October or November, meaning two or three months before the start of the season, licenses allocated before 1 January are valid from the start of the season onwards.

In winter sports, license penalties are applied after a specific date announced in the annual letter but only to athletes who had been already registered and licensed in a previous season. Since migration of the winter sports to SDMS, this key date is set to 1 October in all sports; only current exception is Para ice hockey for season 2014/15 with 1 September as deadline. The penalty fee for hockey teams automatically applies after the deadline even if the country had never licensed a team before.

Winter seasons begin on 1 July and end on 30 June of the next year. Athletes in winter sports are licensed as of the day the IPC Finance Departments registers the final booking of the full amount of payment, and the license expires on 30 June.
