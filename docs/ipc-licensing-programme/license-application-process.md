# License Application Process

While licenses were bought for individual athletes in both summer and winter sports with the introduction of the IPC Licensing Programme, the structure of license fees has changed for summer sports with effect from summer season 2017. This chapter provides a basic step-for-step instruction from registration to final licensing, especially to underline the difference between individual license applications and license packages. Details on the processes and related technical steps in SDMS are outlined in the respective chapters of this guide.

## Summer Sport Licenses – License Packages

> How To: License an athlete in a summer sport.

1. Register a new athlete or update an existing athlete by uploading all required data and documents as explained in [Registration Process](ipc-licensing-programme/registration-process.md).
   
2. Wait for 1-2 workdays until the IPC Sport has reviewed the registration so that the athlete appears in the license section with status *New* (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)).

   a. If the status is not valid, comments explain the issue to be resolved. Once resolved, the assistant within the IPC Sport shall be contacted for review request of the updated documents or data.

   b. If the athlete does not appear within 2 workdays, ensure that all documents and data are uploaded as required, and nationality is confirmed.

   c. If the athlete still does not appear although the profile is correctly filled, the IPC Sport shall be contacted.

3. Make sure that your NPC or NF has paid the licensing invoice for the actual season (see [NPC License Packages](license-management/npc-license-packages.md)). When the licensing invoice has been paid, you can license an unlimited number of athletes.

4. Go to the **License Overview & Application** page, and select the athlete(s) to be licensed in a specific sport for the actual or next season (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)). After final confirmation, all athletes are immediately Licensed. Consult [License Application Process](ipc-licensing-programme/license-application-process.md#license-fees-and-validity) for rules of license validity.      

## Winter Sport Licenses - Individual Application

> How To: License an athlete in a winter sport.

1. Register a new athlete or update an existing athlete by uploading all required data and documents as explained in [Registration Process](ipc-licensing-programme/registration-process.md).
   
2. Wait for 1-2 workdays until the IPC Sport has reviewed the registration so that the athlete appears in the license section with status New (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)).

   a. If the status is not valid, comments explain the issue to be resolved. Once resolved, the assistant within the IPC Sport shall be contacted for review request of the updated documents or data.

   b. If the athlete does not appear within 2 workdays, ensure that all documents and data are uploaded as required, and nationality is confirmed.

   c. If the athlete still does not appear although the profile is correctly filled, the IPC Sport shall be contacted.

3. Go to the license page, and select the athlete(s) to be licensed in a specific sport and a specific license programme for the actual or next season (see [License Overview & Application](license-management/license-overview-and-application.md)). During the process, an invoice specifically related to the selected athletes shall be printed and immediately paid. License status changes to *Pending* for all athletes.
   
4. Wait for 1-3 weekdays until the IPC Finance Department has confirmed the payment of the license package (see [License Cards](license-management/license-cards.md)). The duration of confirmation might take up to five (5) weekdays depending on your home country and way of payment.
   
   a. If the payment status of the invoice and the license status of the related athletes is still pending after five (5) weekdays, the IPC Finance Department has to be contacted and provided with any kind of proof (signed bank transfer documents, receipts…).

5. Once the payment is confirmed, all athletes are *Licensed*. Consult [License Fees and Validity](#license-fees-and-validity) for rules of license validity.

## License Fees and Validity

The license fee and validity policy might vary from season to season by sport. Details about the currently applied fee structure can be found in the letter about the IPC Licensing Programme of the respective season.

The license fee (on a per-sport basis) will be invoiced annually and will allow access to an **UNLIMITED** number of licenses for your NPC in the relevant sport for the season. The fee that is charged per NPC, per sport and is calculated as the average number of licenses (rounded) activated in the sport per season, multiplied by €15 euro per license, plus a €20 euro fixed fee to cover any administration cost (bank charges etc.) that IPC may incur.

> Example:

**No. of athletes licensed by the NPC per season**

|  Para Powerlifting  |  22   |  28   |  28   |  30   |   27    |                          € 430                           |
| Shooting Para Sport |  15   |  18   |  22   |  35   |   23    |                          € 360                           |
|    Para Swimming    |  20   |  25   |  33   |  39   |   29    |                          € 460                           |
|  Para Dance Sport   |  20   |  20   |  50   |   5   |   21    |                          € 340                           |

NPCs do not need to apply for any license package or invoice. An invoice for licenses per Sport will be created automatically by SDMS at the start of each season and should be downloaded by the NPC via SDMS. However, address and tax information must be completed by the NPC before the invoice is valid.

Please transfer the amount in question to the account indicated on the invoice. If the package is bought and athletes are licensed before 31 December their licenses are valid from 01 January onwards. After 01 January, the licenses will be active from the date of activation.

The validity of a license generally begins on the day when the NPC officially licensed the athlete with help of purchased and paid license package until the 31 December of the respective season. Since the licensing programme usually opens in October or November, meaning two or three months before the start of the season, licenses allocated before 1 January are valid from the start of the season onwards.

In winter sports, license penalties are applied after a specific date announced in the annual letter but only to athletes who had been already registered and licensed in a previous season. Since migration of the winter sports to SDMS, this key date is set to 1 October in all sports; only current exception is Para Ice Hockey for season 2014/15 with 1 September as deadline. The penalty fee for hockey teams automatically applies after the deadline even if the country had never licensed a team before.

Winter seasons begin on 1 July and end on 30 June of the next year. Athletes in winter sports are licensed as of the day the IPC Finance Departments registers the final booking of the full amount of payment, and the license expires on 30 June.

## Payment Options

The standard payment option is the bank transfer order. The IPC bank account details are indicated on the invoice. The payer shall ensure that he bears for any additional bank fees.

> [!DANGER]
> The invoice number or numbers covered by the payment shall be indicated during the remittance order. The payer's effort in this regard is appreciated for simplification of payment identification and to avoid delays in the licensing process.

Credit card payment is no longer available. In exceptional cases, a specific request for an alternative solution may be sent to the IPC Finance Department if the standard method of money transfer does not work due to country-specific restrictions and limitations.

> [!DANGER]
> Please indicate the invoice number on the payment form. The IPC has previously faced some problems in tracking payments, leading to a delay in activating licenses. We kindly request you to send a proof of payment immediately to the IPC Finance Department at [accounts@paralympic.org](mailto:accounts@paralympic.org) if your payment is not confirmed in SDMS within one week.

## Licensing Regulations

### Summer Sports

There are no major changes to the regulations for 2019. However, we remind you of the following requirements:

- All athletes in Shooting MUST have a completed Athlete Epilepsy Declaration Form uploaded to their SDMS profile in order to complete athlete registration and be eligible for licensing.

- All athletes in Athletics and Swimming with an intellectual impairment (T/F20 in Athletics, S14 in Swimming), who hold New “N” or Review “R” sport class status, MUST have a completed Training History and Sport Activity Limitation Questionnaire (TSAL-Q) not older than 12 months, uploaded to their SDMS profile, and must have met the INAS Eligibility Criteria (checked through the INAS Eligibility Masterlist) in order to complete athlete registration and be eligible for licensing.

- All athletes in all sports (Athletics, Swimming, Powerlifting, Shooting and Dance Sport) with a physical or vision impairment (PI and VI), who hold New “N”, Review “R” or Review 2019 sport class status, MUST have a completed Medical Diagnostic Form (MDF) and supporting medical documents (if applicable) uploaded to their SDMS profile in order to complete athlete registration and be eligible for licensing.

- To be eligible to be licensed, or relicensed, to participate in IPC competitions all athletes are required to agree to the terms outlined in the IPC Athlete Eligibility Agreement (version two). Those athletes who signed version one, however, are not required to sign version two (but certainly may do so if desired). Instead, these athletes’ respective NPCs will be required to supply such athletes with a copy of version two and ensure those athletes accept the terms of version two. NPCs will be required to confirm that these steps have been completed as provided in SDMS. Any athlete who does not agree to the terms of version two will not be relicensed.

- An athlete needs to be licensed prior to a competition for his/her results to be recognised for rankings and records. The unlimited licence packages allow immediate licensing after confirmed registration.

- Since 2012 guide runners for athletes with a visual impairment must obtain a World Para Athletics licence in order to compete in track events at the Paralympic Games, World Championships and Regional Championships and some specific World Para Sport Recognised Competitions. The licensing process for athletes and guides remains the same.

- An athlete with a New “N” or Review “R with no fixed date” sport class status needs to undergo an international classification assessment within six (6) weeks in Athletics, Powerlifting, Shooting and Swimming after a record breaking performance for official record recognition.

- Athlete Identification Cards and seasonal Licence Cards can be printed out for the new summer season 2019. SDMS offers a section under **Licence Management** to select licensed athletes and download their cards as PDF files for printing and distribution.
