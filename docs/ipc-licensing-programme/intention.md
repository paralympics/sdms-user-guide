# Intention

Excerpt from the letter ‘2009 IPC Athletics Athletes License Registration Process’, sent out by David Grevemberg in December 2008:

<span class="asterisk">“</span>
[…], it is the IPC’s intention to create a comprehensive global registry of active athletes by sport that are licensed and eligible to compete in IPC competitions. The licensing process and associated fees replace the previously levied IPC capitation taxes that where levied on participants at IPC competitions.

The IPC [has] launch[ed] a web based database application in January 2009. The application is called the IPC Sport Data Management System (SDMS). […], the general functionality of the online application includes the following:

- Captures athlete biographies, eligibility data (nationality, classification, etc.), results, potential records;
- Provides NPCs with online reports and data for their respective athletes;
- Calculates world and regional rankings, records and other reports (eg classification master lists) and
- Automates the athlete registration and license payment and invoices processes online.
