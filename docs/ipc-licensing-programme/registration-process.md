# Registration Process

The NPC must register those athletes who compete for the respective country. Complete registration and initialization of the review process by the IPC requires following information and documents for each athlete:

- [x] Personal data – passport name, preferred name, gender, date of birth
- [x] Nationality data – to fulfil the IPC Athlete Nationality Policy (see chapter [IPC Athlete Nationality Policy](#ipc-athlete-nationality-policy))
- [x] IPC Eligibility Agreement – correctly signed (see [IPC Eligibility Agreement](#ipc-eligibility-agreement))
- [x] Photo – for guidelines see [File Attachments](layout-and-functionalities/file-attachments.md)
- [x] Sport Class – for identification of the sport the athlete shall be licensed in
- [x] Medical Diagnostic Form – mandatory for all athletes undergoing first classification (see [Medical Diagnostic Forms](#medical-diagnostic-forms))

Guidelines of the registration pathway can be found in [Registration & Update](participants/registration-and-update.md). The user shall keep in mind that the registration of athletes in SDMS is free of charge and can be done anytime.

As soon as all documents have been added to the athlete’s SDMS profile, IPC reviews correctness within 1-2 workdays.

> [!DANGER]
> IPC does not inform the NPC that documents are missing. IPC only informs the NPC when signatures on the IPC Eligibility Agreement are missing, photo not being acceptable or other inserted values not fulfilling the requirements.

Feedback about non-accepted documents or data can be found in the comment box in the license overview screen. Only in urgent cases, the NPC is individually contacted. In either case, the outstanding information has to be corrected and completed, and the IPC personally informed that the reasons for grievance are resolved for IPC’s next review.

## IPC Athlete Nationality Policy

“Any competitor participating in the Paralympic Games in any Paralympic Sport, or in competitions for those sports that are governed by the IPC as International Federation (IF) […] must be a national of the country of the NPC which is entering such competitor.

In specific and/or exceptional circumstances this rule may be interpreted or reconsidered by the IPC as outlined in section 3 [of IPC Athlete Nationality Policy].”

<p class="footnote">
    <small >IPC Handbook, Section II, Chapter 3.1, §1, as of 3 Dec 2011</small>
</p>

All documents of the handbook can be found on the IPC Website.

In general, athletes who ever had the nationality of those countries they are competing for can be registered and licensed while fulfilling all other criteria as outlined in this section. But in the following scenarios the IPC and/or the IPC Governing Board must review the case:

- The athlete has not obtained (yet) the nationality of that country she/he likes to compete for.
- The athlete is stateless.
- The athlete had ever competed for another country before, especially at Paralympic Games or other IPC sanctioned competitions, and likes to compete now for his new home country. This case has to be considered independently of his actual nationality.

The list of scenarios might be incomplete so that each situation or circumstances which breaks the policy of the very first sentence in the IPC Athlete Nationality Policy as cited above has to be reviewed by the IPC. In any of those cases or on any concerns and questions, the NPC is obliged to contact the IPC Membership Relations Manager.

> [!DANGER]
> When the NPC enters an athlete with a different nationality, the athlete’s registration remains uncompleted unless IPC is contacted.

### How To: Solve a nationality issue

1. When a nationality issue occurs, contact the IPC Membership Relations Manager. Their email address is indicated in the nationality section in the athlete’s profile.
2. In addition to other documents required for the basic registration process, upload a copy of the athlete’s actual passport.
3. Provide all additional required documents as the IPC requests. Review of the nationality issue can only follow on complete submission. Depending on the individual situation, these documents might be confirmation letters of the previous NPC, approval of residence etc.
4. IPC reviews the case and decides on the provided documents and information according to the IPC Athlete Nationality Policy.
5. IPC informs about the decision by an official letter. In a positive decision, the athlete is eligible to be licensed by the new NPC.

In the case that an athlete was registered or even licensed under his previous NPC, he remains under the responsibility of that NPC until IPC confirms his eligibility for the new one.

Recognition of results achieved for the previous country, especially for qualification purposes, is subject to sport specific regulations and shall be individually discussed.

## IPC Eligibility Agreement

Registration of an athlete can only be completed if he agrees to a set of IPC policies, rules, regulations, and acceptances. This form is called the IPC Eligibility Agreement. The most updated version can be found by clicking the information button in the Eligibility Agreement field when registering an athlete, or from each World Para sport website.

At the top, a few key details identify the athlete by responsible NPC, name, date of birth, gender, and sport. At the bottom, following signatures are required:

- Signature of the athlete. In a case that the athlete is not able to sign documents, IPC has to be contacted.
- Signature of the person from the NPC or the National Sport Federation responsible for registration and licensing of this athlete, and an official stamp of the NPC or NF.
- The signature of a parent or legal guardian if the athlete is considered a minor according to the national laws of the NPC.
- The signature of a legal guardian if the athlete lacks legal capacity according to your national laws.

The fully signed document must be scanned and uploaded as PDF with a maximum file size of 1.25 MB on the athlete’s SDMS profile. During the review process, the completeness of the document is controlled and is complained about if incomplete. To avoid delays in the registration and licensing process, it is highly recommended to care for completeness from the beginning.

When completing the form, the athlete also has the option to consent to the IPC’s usage of their personal data for research and marketing purposes. Please transfer the choices the athlete makes into the check boxes on the athlete’s profile page.

In case of an athlete whose visual impairment is so severe that they cannot read the agreement, the agreement must be read out to them. However, the athlete still has to sign the document personally; if an assistant guides their hand to the signature line on the document, the name of the assistant shall be included on the line ‘legal guardian’.

## Medical Diagnostic Forms

Before an athlete can be classified in a particular sport, the NPC or NF must submit medical diagnostic forms as evidence, provided by the athlete’s individual physician. The forms are different for each sport, and are available from the official IF websites under [paralympic.org](https://www.paralympic.org/). From 2017 onwards, all athletes who have not been internationally classified must upload a Medical Diagnostic Form before they can be licensed.

### How To: Upload a Medical Diagnostic Form

1. To upload a signed form, please go to *Participants > Athlete Classification* from the menu bar, and open the classification details page of the athlete.
2. Click the Documentation tab for the relevant sport (e.g. *Documentation – Swimming*)
3. Under *Medical Form 1*, click the button provided to upload files from your local computer (see Figure 3.1)
4. Find the file on your local computer, click Save to return to the browser, and click the Upload button in the web application to transfer the file to IPC.
5. If the document is of the correct type and size, it will be available in the slot Medical Form 1 with a link titled *Show Document (PDF)*. Please ensure that the document has been correctly uploaded before closing or leaving the classification detials page.
