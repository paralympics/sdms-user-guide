# License Programmes

Some IPC sports have a tiered system of license categories, where one type of license only allows you to compete in certain competitions. Currently, four different license programmes are implemented:

**IPC Standard License**: Allows recognition of results in all IPC events under the standard rules as explained above.

**Women’s Team Licensing**: In ice sledge hockey, women’s teams are licensed separately and for lower fees than the standard team in order to stimulate the development of women’s ice sledge hockey. Women can also play as part of a mixed team; if so, they should be licensed using the standard programme.

**National License**: In Para Alpine skiing, athletes can obtain a National license to compete in certain low-level competitions. The price is lower, but the athletes are not eligible to earn points for the official rankings.

**Youth License**: Young athletes in Para Alpine skiing can participate in youth competitions with this license. The selection of athletes is restricted by the age criteria specified in alpine skiing rules.

When selecting a particular license category for licensing, only the sports where that programme is enabled appear from the sport drop-down box.
