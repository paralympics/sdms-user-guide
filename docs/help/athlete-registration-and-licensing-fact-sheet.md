# Athlete Registration & Licensing Fact Sheet

## Summer Sports

### Athlete Registration and Licence

Athletes must be registered in the Sport Data Management System (SDMS) to be eligible to be licensed and internationally classified.

There is no cost to register an athlete in the SDMS. All registered athletes will be assigned a unique identification code, the SDMS ID, which will remain with the athlete for the duration of his/her career and will be included on all athlete documentation.

Athletes must be licensed in the SDMS to have their results eligible for recognition for official rankings and as record-breaking performances.

An athlete will be considered licensed once their NPC/NSF has applied for a season licence in one sport and the licence package fee payment has been confirmed by the IPC. All licensed athletes will be assigned a season licence number for the respective sport.

Should an athlete retire from competition, it is the responsibility of his/her NPC/NSF to officially declare their retirement by cancelling the athlete registration in the SDMS and notifying the IPC in writing.

### Athlete Participation

At the Paralympic Games, World Championships and Regional Championships and some specific World Para Sport Recognised Competitions all athletes and guide runners must be licensed to compete. This requirement will be included in the qualification guides of these competitions. Further requirements for eligibility to compete like an additional licensing deadline will be outlined in these guides if applicable.

At other World Para Sport Recognised Competitions only athletes that are licensed may have their results recognised.
