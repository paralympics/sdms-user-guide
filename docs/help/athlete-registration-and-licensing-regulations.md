# Athlete Registration & Licensing Regulations

## World Para Athletics

### Athlete Registration and Licence

Athletes must be registered in the Sport Data Management System (SDMS) to be eligible to be licensed and internationally classified. Guide-runners must also be registered to be eligible to be licensed.

There is no cost to register an athlete or guide-runner in the SDMS. All registered athletes/guide-runners will be assigned a unique identification code, the SDMS ID, which will remain with the athlete/guide-runner for the duration of his/her career and will be included on all athlete documentation.

Athletes with an intellectual impairment (T/F20), who hold New “N” or Review “R” sport class status, MUST have a completed Training History and Sport Activity Limitation Questionnaire (TSAL-Q) not older than 12 months, uploaded to their SDMS profile, and must have met the Virtus (formally INAS) Eligibility Criteria, checked through the Virtus eligibility master list, in order to complete athlete registration and be eligible for licensing.

Athletes with a physical or vision impairment (PI and VI), who hold New “N”, Review “R” or Review 2021 (including any Fixed Review Date before 2021) sport class status, MUST have a completed Medical Diagnostic Form (MDF) and applicable supporting medical documents uploaded to their SDMS profile in order to complete athlete registration and be eligible for licensing.

To be eligible to be licensed, or relicensed, to participate in IPC Competitions and World Para Athletics Sanctioned Competitions, all athletes are required to agree to the terms outlined in the IPC Athlete Eligibility Agreement (version two). Those athletes who signed version one, however, are not required to sign version two (but certainly may do so if desired). Instead, these athletes’ respective NPCs will be required to supply such athletes with a copy of version two and ensure those athletes accept the terms of version two. NPCs will be required to confirm that these steps have been completed as provided in SDMS. Any athlete who does not agree to the terms of version two will not be relicensed.

Athletes must be licensed in the SDMS prior to a competition for his/her results to be recognised for official rankings and records.

An athlete will be considered licensed once their NPC/NSF has applied for a season licence and the licence package fee payment has been confirmed by the IPC. All licensed athletes will be assigned a season licence number.

Should an athlete retire from competition, it is the responsibility of his/her NPC/NSF to officially declare their retirement by cancelling the athlete registration in the SDMS and notifying the IPC in writing.

(R): Review “R” fixed date (which is after the date when the record was achieved) sport class status.

If a record-breaking performance is set by an athlete with a New “N” or Review “R” sport class status at a World Para Sport Recognised competition, the NPC has six (6) weeks after the end of the competition to present the athlete for an international classification assessment. The record-breaking performance will be recognised if the outcome of the athlete’s classification assessment validates the original sport class and he/she is allocated a Confirmed “C” or Review “R” fixed date (FRD) sport class status.

### Classification

### Qualification

### Athlete Registration and Licence

Athletes must be registered in the Sport Data Management System (SDMS) to be eligible to be licensed and internationally classified.

There is no cost to register an athlete in the SDMS. All registered athletes will be assigned a unique identification code, the SDMS ID, which will remain with the athlete for the duration of his/her career and that will be included on all athlete documentation.

Athletes must be licensed in the SDMS to have their results eligible for recognition for Official Rankings.

An athlete will be considered licensed once their NPC/NSF has applied for a season licence in one sport and the licence package fee payment has been confirmed by the IPC. All licensed athletes will be assigned a season licence number for the respective sport.

Should an athlete retire from competition, it is the responsibility of his/her NPC/NSF to officially declare their retirement by cancelling the athlete registration in the SDMS and notifying the IPC in writing.

### Athlete Participation

At all WPAS/WPSB/WPNS Recognised Competitions all athletes and guides must be licensed to compete. This requirement will be included in the qualification guides of these competitions. Further requirements for eligibility to compete like an additional licensing deadline will be outlined in these guides if applicable.

### Qualification

For each IPC Recognised Competition with a qualification criteria, the IPC will outline the specific eligibility conditions that athletes are required to meet to participate in that competition, including nationality, Minimum Qualification Standards, International Classification Sport Status, Athletes Licensing requirements, etc.
