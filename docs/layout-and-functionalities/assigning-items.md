# Assigning Items

Some individual elements of SDMS contain lists of other elements; for example, a competition in athletics would have a list of all the events taking place at the competition. Adding and removing items from such lists is done through two search forms named Available and Assigned and items are assigned and removed by selecting them by checkbox and then clicking the **Assign** or **Remove** arrow.

Figure 2.9 shows an assignment screen, for defining a list of athletes related to a particular guide. The ‘assignee’ which will store the items the user assigns is shown in green, while the athletes to be assigned are listed on the search form. The lists of available and assigned can be further restricted by entering search criteria as in other search forms.

It is also possible to assign using drag and drop functionality; click and hold the row with the record and drag it to the correct table.
