## Recommended Browsers

It is recommended to use most modern and widely used browsers with recent updates installed in order to ensure stable functionality and security. SDMS runs best under Firefox (current version 50) and Google Chrome (version 54). Users of Internet Explorer (version 7 or higher) shall regularly update and inform about potential general security issues and either care for a stable version of look for alternatives. Additionally, JavaScript has to be enabled for correct functionality of SDMS.

## Account Request

Currently, there are four main user groups defined. The most important client group are the National Paralympic Committees (NPCs). Additionally, recognised classifiers have temporary access to the classification section to read out or even change information. Last, but not least, the IPC Management Team runs all remaining procedures and supports the NPCs and classifiers. Besides those three groups, there a several individual temporary accounts opened for various purposes.

> [!DANGER]
> Please share your personal account details with any colleague only if you take on full responsibility for all actions performed through your SDMS account.

### NPC Account

Each NPC obtains one (1) SDMS account (primary user) to access all athletes in all IPC Sports stored in the system. This primary account must be designated to an employee of the National Paralympic Committee. Additionally, IPC may grant one (1) additional sport specific account. These accounts may be used by employees of the NPC or any national sport federation in order to decentralize the obligation of athletes’ registration and licensing. An individual person may hold two or more sport-specific accounts.

#### How To: Apply for an SDMS NPC account

1. Download the NPC Account Request Form for SDMS. The recent version is attached to this document’s appendix.
2. For the primary user, tick ‘no change’ if the user remains the same, ‘update’ for a change of email address or ‘new/replace’ for replace the responsible person.
3. For a sport-specific account, insert the sport(s) and tick ‘new/replace’.
4. Get the document signed by the president or secretary general of the NPC and send it back to the SDMS Administrator as indicated on the form.
5. The SDMS Administrator will send out individual emails to each designated person with his/her personal username and password.

#### How To: Change or update an SDMS NPC account

1. Download the NPC Account Request Form for SDMS.
2. For the primary user, tick ‘no change’ if the user remains the same, ‘update’ for a change of email address or ‘new/replace’ for replace the responsible person.
3. If one or more sport-specific accounts change, tick ‘new/replace’ for an entire replacement of the responsible person or ‘update’ for change of email address.
4. Get the document signed by the president or secretary general of the NPC and send it back to the SDMS Administrator as indicated on the form.
5. The SDMS Administrator will send out individual emails to each designated person with his/her personal username and password. If an account has been removed in order to create the new one, the previous user will be informed about the new status

‘New/Replace’ always leads to the creation of a new username if the individual responsible person has changed. In contrast, ‘update’ keeps the username as long as the responsible person does not change but only his/her contact details or organization/position.

If a National Paralympic Committee user wishes to use their login details in a sister application developed for other sports federations within the Paralympic Movement – e.g. the IBSA Sport Administration System –they should submit such a request by email to [sdmsadmin@paralympic.org](mailto:sdmsadmin@paralympic.org).

## Security and Passwords

SDMS is a password-protected application. This protection requires high standard beginning with usage of strong passwords. Strength of a password is primarily defined by its length and its used character set. To find a compromise between security and user-friendliness, a password for SDMS and all its related modules requires:

- [x] Minimum length of eight (8) characters
- [x] At least one (1) lower-case letter [a-z]
- [x] At least one (1) upper-case letter [A-Z]
- [x] At least one (1) numeric character [0-9]
- [x] At least one (1) non-alphanumeric character out of the set [!_%#?-@=$&+]

As it is recommended for all Internet applications like amazon, SDMS automatically reminds the user to change his password when one year after last password change have passed.

> [!WARNING]
> Your account is automatically disabled after five sequential failed login attempts.

However, the user can re-open his account on his own by using the password reset tool. Instructions are given below.

#### How To: Change your password

1. After you have entered the application, go to Edit Password at the upper right corner of SDMS. This screen automatically opens after the one year expiry period.

2. Enter your current password in the first field. Enter your new password in the second field, then repeat it. The new password is automatically controlled against the password requirements; if the password does not meet the requirements, the field changes colour to red and saving the new password will not be accepted. Confirm your new password and submit.

#### How To: Reset password when you have forgotten it

1. Click on **I forgot my password** or use the menu bar **User Management > Password Reset**.
2. Fill out the form by inserting your username and email address which had been registered with your account.
3. After submission, you receive an automatically generated email with a link to allow you to reset your password (Figure 2.3). Check your spam folder if can’t find the message in your inbox.
4. Once you click the link, your web browser will open with a page where you can input your new password (Figure 2.4). Please note that this page will expire after 15 minutes.
5. You will then be redirected to the SDMS login page, and you may now enter the application with the new password.

Passwords are stored encrypted. That means that no one, even not the SDMS Administrator can read out your password. Same security standard is applied to other sensible information, such as medical forms uploaded as PDF.

SDMS logs you out after a certain set time (10-60 minutes) of inactivity. This counter applies to each window or tab of your web browser independently from each other; but once your session is deleted in one of these tabs, your access in all of them is denied unless you relogin. That shall reduce the risk that a stranger with access to your terminal manipulates the data through your account with your knowledge. Especially in a public environment, it is highly recommended to click **Logout** when you finished your work in SDMS.
