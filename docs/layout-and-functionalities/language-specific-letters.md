# Language Specific Letters

As English is the language of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), only letters from the English alphabet in Latin writing as well as Arabic numbers shall be used. This especially applies to proper names of athletes.

In addition to that, the standard set for punctuation (English grammar) is allowed. For names of persons, only two characters are allowed: the hyphen/dash for names combination (like for Muller-Smith) and the standard apostrophe (like in D’Andrea).

On purpose, SDMS does not store characters in other writing systems. On attempt to store Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese etc. characters, only question markers or white boxes return. Only a few fields allow storage of such writing systems this guide will point out in these particular cases.
