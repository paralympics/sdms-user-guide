# License Renewal

When athletes are entered into SDMS by NPCs, IPC must verify that all requirements have been fulfilled as explained in [Registration Process](ipc-licensing-programme/registration-process.md) before the athlete is available for licensing. The *License Renewal* screen centralises all information regarding a registration and allows sport officers to quickly approve or reject an application.

The results in the search form are not displayed in matrix form as on other screens, but instead within boxes containing information about the newly registered athletes. The season and sport must be specified before any search can be performed, though the sport is automatically selected if the user can only modify data related to one sport. The most recent currently active summer season is automatically selected.

Licenses are approved on a season-by-season basis. As, for example, a summer season’s licensing programme usually opens on 1 November the year before the season begins, this means two seasons will be running concurrently during November and December. In that case, registrations must be verified for both seasons so that the athlete can be licensed in both seasons. To do this, the user must change the season value and search again for the already approved athletes, and complete the verification process by clicking the associated buttons.

Some young athletes will only be available to be registered for one of the two seasons because they have only met the license age limit for the most recent season, but this is automatically checked by the script.

A maximum of 12 athletes can be displayed in one search, organized in four rows of three athletes each. Only the athletes meeting the five registration criteria but have yet not been added to any licensing programme for that season appear. Additionally, the restriction on age specified in the licence definition is applied here, thus athletes younger than the licensing age are not listed.

The following information is displayed about each athlete:
- Photo
- SDMS ID
- family name, given name (preferred forms)
- date of birth
- age in brackets following date of birth, coloured red if less than 18
- nationality document number and expiry date
- INAS number if applicable
- PDF of nationality document, if uploaded. If not, displays **not uploaded**
- PDF of eligibility code form.

If all documents have been correctly submitted – e.g. photo is of sufficient quality, eligibility code form is signed and stamped correctly, etc. – IPC can accept the registration. There are two ways to verify the registration and add the athletes to the licensing programme. The first possibility is to use the button *Validate All*, which allocates the license status *New* to all athletes and allows for NPCs to grant licenses to all athletes listed. Otherwise, click on the tools icon of the athlete’s box, which opens up the dialogue box *Decide on License Renewal* (Figure 6.8).

In this dialogue box, there are three options, explained on the screen to the user. To accept the registration, click *OK*, else click *Not OK* and enter the reason for the refusal. The athlete is still added to the licensing programme, but with status *Registration Incomplete* and with the entered reason as a comment. NPCs are thus required to check the License Overview & Application screen for the result of the registration process. They should then change the required documents and notify IPC of the update, and the IPC Sport can then unfreeze them if the registration has now been corrected.

There are no separate license renewals for the different license categories; once an athlete is approved, they are added to all the categories they are eligible for, depending on their age, gender, etc. It is then up to the NPC to assign the correct license category.
