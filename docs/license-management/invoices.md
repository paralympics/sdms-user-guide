# Invoices

Once an invoice has been issued by the system, it must be stored so that it can be accessed by the finance department for an eventual confirmation of the payment status. These invoices can be viewed in this section, along with invoices issued for other IPC processes such as competition participation or approval. Invoices can not be created or deleted directly from this screen: instead they are created as a result of other processes within SDMS. The invoice details are displayed in a table, with printable PDFs available for archiving and documentation.
