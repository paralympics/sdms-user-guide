# Duplicate Control
The duplicate control functionality is used to produce PDF reports indicating possible duplicate entries in SDMS. The search is customizable and automatically restricted by user data access.

The search criteria are specified by the following fields:

| **Field**                  | **Format**        | **Comments**                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NPC**                    | drop down [NPC]   | restriction, default (All) searches all NPCs available to user – can restrict to 1 NPC                                          |
| **Sport**                  | drop down [Sport] | as above                                                                                                                            |

The criteria work in conjunction – the search only returns items that are equal on all selected criteria, within any possible restriction by NPC and/or sport.

Clicking the Search button opens a new tab in the browser with a PDF of the matches. Except for sport, all personal data which can be searched is also displayed here, along with the career status of the athlete.

If you find a duplicate entry, please report it as soon as possible to the relevant IPC Sport or to the IPC database administrators.
