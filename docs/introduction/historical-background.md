# Historical Background

Alongside the fast growing size of the Paralympic Movement, in 2007 the IPC discovered the need of a database solution for the IPC governed sports including the introduction of an IPC Licensing Programme to offer a comprehensive global registry of active athletes by sport.

The first version of SDMS was launched for January 2009 in the sports of Para athletics and Para swimming plus the newly introduced IPC Licensing Programme for all five summer sports that are governed by the IPC. About 70 NPCs registered and licensed 3,000 athletes in both sports. With help of this storage of information it does not only allow a faster and more accurate calculation and presentation of data, but also acts as a tool to specifically find out potential or obvious needs for further developments (countries & sports) within the Paralympic Movement.

In January 2010, SDMS was opened for the remaining IPC summer sports, namely Para powerlifting, Shooting para sport, and Para dance sport. In total, 6,000 athletes in all five sports were licensed for 2010, just in athletics and swimming, the number of licensed athletes increased by 1,600 to 4,600.

Additionally, the registration and licensing programme already running in all three IPC winter sports (para Alpine skiing, Para Nordic skiing, and Para Ice hockey) for several seasons was implemented in SDMS in July 2010 for the following season 2010/11, increasing the number of licensed athletes by additional 1,000.

The change of the licensing structure in the summer sports as well as the global collected experience of two years in handling SDMS and the related procedures came up with the second version of SDMS launched in December 2010. The new structure and layout increased the degree of flexibility for all processes realized inside the application, NPC and IPC related ones, and publishing data to the IPC Website live from SDMS to avoid any kind of redundancy. SDMS has become the central tool for athlete's data, classification, competition calendar, achieved results, confirmed records, and calculation mechanism of rankings and qualification lists for major events.

At the same time, first versions of an entry system, simplifying the entry by name process, for the IPC Swimming World Championships 2010 (Eindhoven, Netherlands) and the IPC Athletics World Championships 2011 (Christchurch, New Zealand) were developed and directly based on SDMS data. That leads to the clear separation between personal and classification related data in SDMS and the entry data in the new module which considered the personal information and classification including the recognised qualification performance to accept or deny entries to a competition automatically. NPCs have been immediately aware of missing steps on their side beforehand (e.g., to license an athlete), the quality of data has increased, and the data exchange protocols with the IT provider on competition site is simplified.

While the initial versions of the entry system were competition-based, the first official EBS version was launched in July 2011 applicable to all competitions, and from now on used for all major competitions in IPC summer sports, and all races in Alpine and Nordic skiing.

In July 2012 and October 2012, respectively, SDMS 3.0 and EBS 2.0 were launched, mainly with more technical improvements and new layouts.

A major relaunch of the application was carried out in 2014 and 2015, with SDMS 4.0 launched on 3 June 2015. This upgrade was based on up-to-date web application paradigms which offer increased security and streamlined introduction of new features.

Additionally, a version of SDMS developed for the International Blind Sport Federation (IBSA) was launched on 1 January 2015. This system, called IBSA Sport Administration System (ISAS) is integrated with SDMS so that National Paralympic Committes who are also member federations of IBSA can use their SDMS account details in ISAS and transfer between the two applications.
