# Versions

Specific user groups of the application have access to a limited number of screens and functionalities. For better targeting the user's search for information, several versions of the SDMS manual are published to specifically focus the processes each user group needs to be aware of.

- **Version A** - A full document containing (almost) all sections of SDMS for overall information for everyone interested in the data processes
- **Version B** - Registration & Licensing for National Paralympic Committees and IPC
- **Version C** - Handling of classification data for Classifiers and IPC
- **Version D** - Competition, Results, and Rankings for IPC

> [!NOTE]
> Versions B to D have the same content structure as Version A for better cross-references, but unimportant sections are excluded for the respective user group.
