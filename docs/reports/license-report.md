# License Report
The license report can be used to keep track of all licensed athletes, with name, date and other information. There are fewer customisable options here, as this is only used for licenses and associating athletes with invoices: it should be used for financial archives and for keeping track of which athletes are licensed for a particular season. By default, all license applications submitted by an NPC are included in the report, independent of finance status; however, completely registered athletes who have not yet been licensed or who are suspended will not be listed.

The section is available to both IPC employees and NPC officers. The search options are as follows:

| **Field**             | **Format**               | **Comments**                                                                      |

| **Sport**             | Drop-down box [sport]    | Populated on season choice                                                        |
| **Region**            | Drop-down box [region]   | Select by region (continent)                                                      |
| **NPC**               | Drop-down box [NPC]      | Select your own NPC                                                               |
| **Only Pending**      | Checkbox                 | Only list those invoices (for license packages) or athletes (for winter licenses) |
| **Only credit cards** | Checkbox                 | Only list licenses associated with credit card payment.                           |

Also, there are three different report types, selectable from a drop-down box, and three different output types, selectable as buttons. By default, the licenses are grouped by NPC in the printed reports; the report types allow you to select more relevant groupings.

- **Invoices & Athletes:** list all invoices and athletes licensed.
- **Invoices:** list only the invoice data.
- **Athletes:** list only the athlete data, but still sorted by invoice number.

In the report output, athletes are always sorted by their invoice number, and then by family name and first name. For each invoice, the date of issue, payment option, amount paid, and payment status and date are all included. The athletes licensed with SDMS ID number, name, gender, date of birth, license ID, license status, and license validity date.

The different output types are
- **Open as PDF:** PDF output with each licensed athlete as a separate row, in sections by invoice. The invoice details are printed in each header row.
- **Open as Excel:** Excel output: invoice details and athlete details are combined in the same row, meaning that the same invoice details are reprinted many times.
- **Open as Map:** Shows a colour-coded world map of licensed athletes. Should only be used for regions or the whole world, and can not be used to show details of single athletes, only counts for one sport or all sports
