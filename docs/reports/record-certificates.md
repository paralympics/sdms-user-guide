# Record Certificates

SDMS offers the opportunity to produce record certificates in order to recognise athletes in Para sports for their achievements. From 2017 onwards, these will . These can then be printed and awarded to the record-breaking athletes.

Before printing records, you must specify the sport and a competition code; for large competitions, you can also supply a start and/or end date to restrict the search further. The application searches for all records with *Confirmed* status that meet the search criteria; if no records match the criteria, you get an error message.

The record certificates are printed as separate pages in a PDF file, with dimensions 311.817 mm by 224.817 mm. The certificates are sorted by NPC and name - if the *separator sheet* option is ticked (default), the name of each NPC is also printed on a separate sheet between the record certificates.

The certificates are formatted differently depending on the sport, but all include the following:
- Record type (world record, European record, junior record, etc.)
- Name of athlete (with English honorific)
- Record-breaking performance
- Name of event in which athlete holds record
- Date of achievement
- Signatures of IPC Chief Executive Officer, World Para Sport Manager, and (for athletics and powerlifting) STC Chairperson
- IPC sport logos
